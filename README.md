\`expo-date-picker\` is a modular and extensible date picker component designed to give developers complete control and customization.

- Four types of selection:
  - `date-time`
  - `date`
  - `time`
  - `date-range`
- Compatible with **Expo**
- Easy to customize
- Built with accessibility and mobile usability in mind
- Internationalization-friendly
- Lightweight and dependency-free (uses only React Native primitives and your own theme utilities)

1. Copy the \`DatePicker\` component from the repository.
2. Make sure to include any dependencies like \`Select\`, \`useChTheme\`, and constants (\`Colors\`, \`Spacing\`, etc.) or adjust to fit your own project structure.
3. Use it in your screen or component.
